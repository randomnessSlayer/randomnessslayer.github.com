  <h2>Android Dev</h2>
  <p>
    About three years ago, I briefly began working on a rudimentary Android App that was essentially a simple high-score game. It's called DotTap and is available <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.randomnessSlayer.dotTap">here</a> on the Google Play Store.
  </p>
  <p>
    The premise is simple enough. Each game starts with two dots. Tapping a dot will cause the dot to disappear and will increment the score by one. Tapping the intersection between two dots \(when possible\) results in an additional point per extra dot tapped and spawns an extra dot. As the game progresses the dots shrink faster and faster. When all the dots are gone, the game is over and the high score is recorded.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently working on another Android App to visualize current "hot topics" via news articles from various media providers.
